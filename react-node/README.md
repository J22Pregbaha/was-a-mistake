## General info

To setup the environment, clone the repository and install dependencies.
It would be easier if you had three separate CLI tabs open.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/J22Pregbaha/was-a-mistake.git
```

```bash
cd was-a-mistake
cd react-node
cd auth-back
npm install
```

```bash
cd was-a-mistake
cd react-node
cd auth-front
npm install
```

```bash
cd was-a-mistake
cd react-node
cd mail-node
npm install
```

You can start each of them with the command below:

```bash
npm start
```

It is important to note that auth-back is set to run on port 8000 while auth-front is set to run on port 3000 and mail-node is set to run on port 8080

## Technologies
