# ...was a mistake (A microservice architecture)

> I wanted to buy a bird. A dove to be exact. But when I got to the bird store I was tricked into buying a crow. Now everyone who comes to my house is freaked out by the large bird in my living room. When I see the fear in their eyes, I just tell them straight up; My crow was a mistake.

## General Info

This project is an authentication web application that allows users to sign up and sign in. Once they sign up, an email is sent to them to confirm the email address before they're allowed to sign in. It uses a micro-service architecture and I am attempting to build it using different technologies. First with ReactJS and Node.js, then with VueJS and Flask.

## Status
