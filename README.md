# ...was a mistake (A microservice architecture)

> I wanted to buy a bird. A dove to be exact. But when I got to the bird store I was tricked into buying a crow. Now everyone who comes to my house is freaked out by the large bird in my living room. When I see the fear in their eyes, I just tell them straight up; My crow was a mistake.
